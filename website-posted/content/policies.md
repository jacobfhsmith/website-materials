### Important Administrative Details

STA 199

### Academic Honesty

Academic honesty is of paramount importance in this class, and all work must be done in accordance with the Duke Community Standard, reproduced as follows:

To uphold the [Duke Community Standard](https://studentaffairs.duke.edu/conduct/about-us/duke-community-standard):
- I will not lie, cheat, or steal in my academic endeavors;
- I will conduct myself honorably in all my endeavors; and
- I will act if the Standard is compromised.

By enrolling in this course, you have agreed to abide by and uphold the provisions of the [Duke Community Standard](https://studentaffairs.duke.edu/conduct/about-us/duke-community-standard) as well as the policies specific to this course. Any violations will automatically result in a grade of 0 on the assignment, be reported to the [Office of Student Conduct](https://studentaffairs.duke.edu/conduct) for further action, and potentially a failing (F) course grade depending on the magnitude of the offense.

**Reusing code**: Unless explicitly stated otherwise, you may make use of online resources (e.g. StackOverflow) for coding examples on assignments. If you directly use code from an outside source (or use it as inspiration), you must or explicitly cite where you obtained the code. Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism. 

On individual assignments, you may not directly share code or write up with other students. On team assignments, you may not directly share code or write up with another team. Unauthorized sharing of the code or write up will be considered a violation for all students involved.

### Activities & Assessments

The following activities and assessments will help you successfully achieve the course learning objectives. By experiencing the course content in different ways, you will not only gain a better understanding of data science, but you will also get experiences that can guide you as you apply what you've learned in future academic and professional projects.
<br> 
<br>

#### Homework (20%)

There are **three (3)** individual homework assignments in this course, one corresponding to each unit. In homework, you will apply what you've learned during lecture and lab to complete data analysis tasks. You may discuss homework assignments with other students; however, homework should be completed and submitted individually. Homework must be typed up using R Markdown and submitted in the appropriate GitHub repository. 

*Your three homework grades will be weighted such that your highest score is worth the most and your lowest score is worth the least [DETAILS??].*
<br> 
<br>

#### Labs (15%)

There are **nine (9)** labs, which will primarily be group-based work. In labs, you will apply the concepts discussed in lecture to various data analysis scenarios with a focus on technology and computation. Most lab assignments will be performed in teams, and all team members are expected to contribute equally to the completion of each assignment. You are expected to use the team's Git repository on the course's GitHub page as as the central platform for collaboration. Commits to this repository will be used as a metric of each team member's relative contribution for each lab, and you will also be asked to evaluate your team members' performance periodically during the semester. 

*The lowest lab grade will be dropped at the end of the semester; only eight lab scores will count toward your final score, to be weighted equally.*
<br> 
<br>

#### Exams (45%) 

There are **three (3)** individual, take-home, open-note exams worth 15% each, one corresponding to each unit. The exams are an opportunity to assess the knowledge and skills you’ve learned. Each exam will include small analysis and computational tasks related to the content discussed in lectures, homework assignments, and labs. More details about the content and structure of the exams will be discussed during the semester.
<br> 
<br>

#### Final Project (15%)

The purpose of the project is to apply what you’ve learned throughout the semester to analyze an interesting data-based research question. The project will be completed in teams, and each team will present their results during [WHEN?!]. *You must complete the final project and present your work in class to pass the course.*
<br> 
<br>

#### Participation and Teamwork (5%)

Note that owing to the asynchronous nature of this course, there is no mandatory live component for the course -- all lectures will be pre-recorded and released on Sakai, and live lecture/lab sessions will be recorded and posted via Zoom. However, **participation in lecture and lab is a firm expectation.** You are still expected to keep up with the material (for instance, by regularly viewing the recorded sessions and responding to PlayPosit discussion questions in a timely manner). Insufficient class engagement will be considered a legitimate cause for grade reduction.

To construct functional and diverse teams, you will be asked to complete a short survey to gauge your previous exposure to data science, programming, and statistics. After completing the survey, you will be assigned to teams of 3-4 students to promote diversity of experiences and consistency of time availability; these teams will stay consistent throughout the semester (barring extraordinary circumstances). You will work in these teams during class, on labs, and on the final project.
<br> 
<br>

#### Grade Calculation

The final grade will be calculated as follows:
 
{.table .table2 .table-condensed .table-striped .text-left}
 <span></span>     | <span></span>  
-----------|---------------------------------
Homework | 20%
Labs | 15%
Exam 1 | 15%
Exam 2 | 15%
Exam 3 | 15%
Final Project | 15%
Participation | 5%

If you have a cumulative numerical average of 90 - 100, you are guaranteed at least an A-, 80 - 89 at least a B-, and 70 - 79 at least a C-. The exact ranges for letter grades will be determined during the course of the semester.

**Regrade requests** for homeworks, labs, and exams must be submitted within **two days** of when the assignment is returned and must be made on Gradescope. For instance, if an assignment is returned anytime on September 1, then students have until September 3 at 11:59 PM to make a regrade request. Regrade requests will be honored if there is an error in the grade calculation or a correct answer was mistakenly marked as incorrect. Note, however, that **regrades may result in a lower grade than originally given.** No grades will be changed after the final project presentations. 

*Grades can only be changed by the instructor. Teaching Assistants cannot change grades on returned assignments.*

<br> 
<br>

### Make-up Policy and Late Work

Students who miss a class due to a scheduled varsity trip, religious holiday, or short-term illness should fill out the appropriate form. These excused absences do not excuse you from work; it will still be your responsibility to submit relevant assignments in accordance with the deadline.

If you have a personal or family emergency or health condition that affects your ability to participate in class, you should contact your academic dean's office. More information about this procedure may be found on the [Personal Emergencies page](https://trinity.duke.edu/undergraduate/academic-policies/personal-emergencies) or provided by your academic dean.

Homework or lab assignments submitted late but within 24 hours of the deadline may be accepted with a 20% penalty. Homework or lab assignments submitted any later will not be accepted. 

**Exam dates cannot be changed and no make-up exams will be given.** If you must miss an exam, your absence must be officially excused before the exam due date. If your absence is excused, the missing exam grade will be imputed at the end of the semester based on your performance on the other exams.

The final project presentations will be [WHEN]. You must complete the final project and present your work during the exam period in order to pass the course. **No late work is accepted on the final project.**
