### Academic Honesty

Academic honesty is of paramount importance in this class, and all work must be done in accordance with the Duke Community Standard, reproduced as follows:

To uphold the [Duke Community Standard](https://studentaffairs.duke.edu/conduct/about-us/duke-community-standard):
- I will not lie, cheat, or steal in my academic endeavors;
- I will conduct myself honorably in all my endeavors; and
- I will act if the Standard is compromised.

By enrolling in this course, you have agreed to abide by and uphold the provisions of the [Duke Community Standard](https://studentaffairs.duke.edu/conduct/about-us/duke-community-standard) as well as the policies specific to this course. Any violations will automatically result in a grade of 0 on the assignment, be reported to the [Office of Student Conduct](https://studentaffairs.duke.edu/conduct) for further action, and potentially a failing (F) course grade depending on the magnitude of the offense.

**Reusing code**: Unless explicitly stated otherwise, you may make use of online resources (e.g. StackOverflow) for coding examples on assignments. If you directly use code from an outside source (or use it as inspiration), you must or explicitly cite where you obtained the code. Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism. 

On individual assignments, you may not directly share code or write up with other students. On team assignments, you may not directly share code or write up with another team. Unauthorized sharing of the code or write up will be considered a violation for all students involved.

### Activities & Assessments

The following activities and assessments will help you successfully achieve the course learning objectives. By experiencing the course content in different ways, you will not only gain a better understanding of data science, but you will also get experiences that can guide you as you apply what you've learned in future academic and professional projects.
<br> 
<br>

#### Homework (20%)

There are **three (3)** individual homework assignments in this course, one corresponding to each unit. In homework, you will apply what you've learned during lecture and lab to complete data analysis tasks. You may discuss homework assignments with other students; however, homework should be completed and submitted individually. Homework must be typed up using R Markdown, correspond to an appropriate GitHub repository, and submitted as a .pdf file to Gradescope in order to receive credit. 

*Your three homework grades will be weighted such that your highest score is worth the most and your lowest score is worth the least [DETAILS??].*
<br> 
<br>

#### Labs (15%)

There are **nine (9)** labs, which will primarily be group-based work. In labs, you will apply the concepts discussed in lecture to various data analysis scenarios with a focus on technology and computation. Most lab assignments will be performed in teams, and all team members are expected to contribute equally to the completion of each assignment. You are expected to use the team's Git repository on the course's GitHub page as as the central platform for collaboration. Commits to this repository will be used as a metric of each team member's relative contribution for each lab, and you will also be asked to evaluate your team members' engagement periodically during the semester. Lab assignments must be typed up using R Markdown, correspond to an appropriate GitHub repository, and submitted as a .pdf file to Gradescope in order to receive credit. 

*The lowest lab grade will be dropped at the end of the semester; the remaining lab scores will be used to calculate your final score, to be weighted equally.*
<br> 
<br>

#### Exams (45%) 

There are **three (3)** individual, take-home, open-note exams worth 15% each, one corresponding to each unit. The exams are an opportunity to assess the knowledge and skills you’ve learned. Each exam will include small analysis and computational tasks related to the content discussed in lectures, homework assignments, and labs. More details about the content and structure of the exams will be discussed during the semester.
<br> 
<br>

#### Final Project (15%)

The purpose of the project is to apply what you’ve learned throughout the semester to analyze an interesting data-based research question. The project will be completed in teams, and each team will present their results during [WHEN?!]. *You must complete the final project and present your work in class to pass the course.*
<br> 
<br>

#### Participation and Teamwork (5%)

Owing to the asynchronous nature of this course, there is no mandatory live 
component for the course -- all lectures will be pre-recorded and released on Sakai, and 
live lecture/lab sessions will be recorded and posted via Zoom. However, keeping up with 
lecture and lab material is a firm expectation. [YOU MUST DO SOMETHING]. 

To construct functional and diverse teams, you will be asked to complete a short survey to gauge your previous exposure to data science, programming, and statistics. After completing the survey, you will be assigned to teams of 3-4 students to promote diversity of experiences and consistency of time availability / time zone; these teams will stay consistent throughout the semester (barring extraordinary circumstances). You will work in these teams for labs and the final project.
<br> 
<br>

#### Grade Calculation

The final grade will be calculated as follows:
 
{.table .table2 .table-condensed .table-striped .text-left}
 <span></span>     | <span></span>  
-----------|---------------------------------
Homework | 20%
Labs | 15%
Exam 1 | 15%
Exam 2 | 15%
Exam 3 | 15%
Final Project | 15%
Participation | 5%

A letter grade will be assigned as follows:  
 
{.table .table2 .table-condensed .table-striped .text-center}
<span></span>     | <span></span>     | <span></span>    | <span></span>    |  <span></span>      
----|----|----|----|----
93 | &le; | A  | &le; | 100
90 | &le; | A- | &lt; | 93 
87 | &le; | B+ | &lt; | 90
83 | &le; | B  | &lt; | 87
80 | &le; | B- | &lt; | 83 
77 | &le; | C+ | &lt; | 80
73 | &le; | C  | &lt; | 77 
70 | &le; | C- | &lt; | 73 
67 | &le; | D+ | &lt; | 70
63 | &le; | D  | &lt; | 67 
60 | &le; | D- | &lt; | 63 
0  | &le; | F  | &lt; | 60 

Regrade requests should be submitted through the regrade request from on Gradescope. Requests for a regrade must be made within a week of when the assignment is returned; requests submitted later will not be considered. You should only submit a regrade request if there is an error in the grade calculation or a correct answer was mistakenly marked as incorrect. You should not submit a regrade to dispute the number of points deducted for an incorrect response. *Please note that by submitting a regrade request, your entire assignment may be regraded and you may potentially lose points.*

Due to the time consuming nature of responding to regrade requests, you **must** attend office hours and ask a member of the teaching team about the feedback before submitting the request. When you submit a request, indicate which member of the teaching team you spoke with. *Grades can only be changed by the instructor. Teaching Assistants cannot change grades on returned assignments.*
<br>

### Diversity and Inclusion

It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well-served by this course, that students' learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that the students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength and benefit. It is my intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity and in alignment with Duke’s Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated; please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for other students or student groups.

Furthermore, I would like to create a learning environment for my students that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities. To help accomplish this, if you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don't hesitate to come and talk with me. If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, your Academic Dean is an excellent resource.

I (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me about it. 
<br> 
<br>

### Accessibility

Duke University is committed to providing equal access to students with documented disabilities. Students with disabilities may contact the [Student Disability Access Office (SDAO)](http://access.duke.edu) to ensure your access to this course and to the program. There you can engage in a confidential conversation about the process for requesting reasonable accommodations both in the classroom and in clinical settings. Students are encouraged to register with the SDAO as soon as they begin the program. **Note that accommodations are not provided retroactively.**
<br> 
<br>

### Where to find help

If you have a question during lecture or lab, feel free to ask it! There are likely other students with the same question, so by asking you will create a learning opportunity for everyone. The teaching team is here to help you be successful in the course. You are encouraged to attend office hours during the times posted on the home page to ask questions about the course content and assignments. A lot of questions are most effectively answered in-person, so office hours are a valuable resource. Please use them!

Outside of class and office hours, any general questions about course content or assignments should be posted on Piazza. There is a chance another student has already asked a similar question, so please check the other posts on Piazza before adding a new question. If you know the answer to a question posted on Piazza, I encourage you to respond!

There are times may need help with the class that is beyond what can be provided by the teaching team. In those instances, I encourage you to visit the [Academic Resource Center (ARC)](https://arc.duke.edu/). The ARC offers free services to all students during their undergraduate careers at Duke. Services include Learning Consultations, Peer Tutoring and Study Groups, ADHD/LD Coaching, Outreach Workshops, and more. Because learning is a process unique to every individual, they work with each student to discover and develop their own academic strategy for success at Duke. Contact the ARC to schedule an appointment. Undergraduates in any year, studying any discipline can benefit!
<br> 
<br>

### Where to find course materials

The course website will have the day-by-day course schedule, policies, and any posted materials such as slides, assignments, or readings. Pre-recorded lecture content videos will be made available on Sakai. Announcements may also be sent to the class by email, so please check your email regularly.
<br> 
<br>

### Make-up Policy and Late Work

The late work policy is designed to provide flexibility while also helping you stay on top of the course work.  

Students who miss a class due to a scheduled varsity trip, religious holiday, or short-term illness should fill out the appropriate form. These excused absences do not excuse you from work; it will still be your responsibility to submit relevant assignments in accordance with the deadline. If you have a personal or family emergency or health condition that affects your ability to participate in class, you should contact your academic dean's office. More information about this procedure may be found on the [Personal Emergencies page](https://trinity.duke.edu/undergraduate/academic-policies/personal-emergencies) or provided by your academic dean.
<br> 
<br>

#### Homeworks and Labs

You will have a 24 hour grace period after the due date of homework and lab assignments to turn them in with no penalty. We recommend using this policy as little as possible, but they are there to provide some stress relief. After the grace period, there is a 20% (flat percentage point) penalty for each day the assignment is late. If there are extreme extenuating circumstances that prevent you from completing an assignment, please contact the instructor and/or your Academic Dean for further discussion.
<br> 
<br>

#### Exams and Project

**No late work is accepted on exams or for the final project.** If no exam is submitted to Gradescope prior to the deadline, we will upload the most recent GitHub commit prior to the deadline as the exam submission.

Exam dates cannot be changed and no make-up exams will be given. If you must miss an exam, the absence must be officially excused *by your Academic Dean* prior to the date the exam is due. If your absence is excused, the missing exam grade will be imputed at the end of the semester based on your performance on the other exams.

**You must take at least two exams, and upload all final project components by the due date in order to pass the course.**
