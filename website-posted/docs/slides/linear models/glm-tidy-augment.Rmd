### Load data

The `pokemon_cleaned` dataset contains data on 896 Pokemon
- Includes Sword and Shield!
- No alternate forms (mega evolutions, regional forms, etc.)
- Contains information on Pokemon name, baseline battle statistics (base stats),
and whether they are legendary (broadly defined)

```{r message=FALSE}
pokemon <- read_csv("data/pokemon_cleaned.csv", na = c("n/a", "", "NA"))
```

### Non-continuous outcomes

- The previous lectures have focused on using linear regression as a tool to
  + Make predictions about new observations
  + Describe relationships 

  
- These examples have all had *continuous* response variables

.question[
Our goal is to make statements about **categorical** response variables
]

---

### Research goals

- Predict whether a Pokemon is a legendary based on its base 
stats
- Describe the relationship between stats and *probability* of being legendary

### Classifying hypothetical Pokemon

Suppose we have some hypothetical Pokemon with the following features. Would we 
classify them as legendary Pokemon?

Crapistat: HP = 55, ATK = 25, DEF = 30, SPA = 60, SPD = 50, SPE = 102

Mediocra: HP = 90, ATK = 110, DEF = 130, SPA = 75, SPD = 80, SPE = 45

Literally Dragonite: HP: 91, ATK: 134, DEF: 95, SPA: 100, SPD: 100, SPE: 80

Broaken: HP = 104, ATK = 125, DEF = 105, SPA = 148, SPD = 102, SPE = 136

# Logistic regression

### Regression difficulties...

Suppose we consider the following model for $p$, the probability of being a legendary Pokemon:
$${p} = \beta_0 + \beta_1HP + \beta_2ATK + \cdots + \beta_6\times SPE$$

.question[
What can go wrong here?
]

---

### Uh oh...

```{r}
library(broom)
pokemon <- pokemon %>% 
  mutate(leg_bin = if_else(legendary == "Yes", 1, 0))
m2 <- lm(leg_bin~hp + atk + def + spa + spd + spe, data = pokemon)

ggplot(data = augment(m2), aes(x = .fitted, y = .resid)) +
  geom_point() + 
  labs(x = "Predicted", y = "Residual", title = "Residual plot")
```

---

### Predicted legendary status

```{r}
ggplot(data = augment(m2), aes(x = .fitted)) +
  geom_histogram() + 
  labs(x = "Predicted Values", y = "Count", 
       title = "Histogram of predictions")
```

---

### From probabilities to log-odds

- Suppose the probability of an event is $p$
- Then the **odds** that the event occurs is $\frac{p}{1-p}$
- Taking the (natural) log of the odds, we have the *logit* of $p$:
$$logit(p) = \log\left(\frac{p}{1-p}\right)$$

--

Note that $p$ is constrained to lie within 0 and 1, but $logit(p)$ can range from $-\infty$ to $\infty$. Let's instead consider the following linear model for the log-odds of $p$:

$${logit(p)} = \beta_0 + \beta_1\times HP + \beta_2\times ATK + \cdots + \beta_6\times SPE$$

---

### Logistic regression

Since there is a one-to-one relationship between probabilities and log-odds, we
can undo the previous function.

.question[
If we create a linear model on the **log-odds**, we can "work backwards" to
obtain predicted probabilities that are guaranteed to lie between 0 and 1
]

--

To "work backwards," we use the **logistic function**:

$$f(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}} = \frac{e^x}{1 + e^x}$$

--

So, our *linear* model for $logit(p)$ is equivalent to

$$p = \frac{e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1HP + \beta_2ATK + \cdots + \beta_6SPE}}{1 + e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1\times HP + \beta_2\times ATK + \cdots + \beta_6\times SPE}}$$

---

### Classification using logistic regression

- With logistic regression, we can obtain predicted *probabilities* of "success"
for a yes/no variable
- Mapping those to binary class probabilities, we have the predicted probability
of being in a class
- By instituting a cut-off value (say, if the probability is greater than 0.5),
we can create a classifier
- This can be extended to more than 2 categories, but that is beyond the scope
of our course (for the curious: multinomial regression)

---

### Returning to Pokemon...

```{r}
logit_mod <- glm(leg_bin ~ hp + atk + def + spa + spd + spe, data = pokemon,
                 family = "binomial")

new_pokemon <- tibble(hp = c(55, 90, 91, 104),
                      atk = c(25, 110, 134, 125),
                      def = c(30, 130, 95, 105),
                      spa = c(60, 75, 100, 148),
                      spd = c(50, 80, 100, 102),
                      spe = c(102, 45, 80, 136))

pred_log_odds <- augment(logit_mod, newdata = new_pokemon) %>% 
  pull(.fitted)
```

Let's work backwards to get predicted probabilities

```{r}
pred_probs <- exp(pred_log_odds)/(1 + exp(pred_log_odds))
round(pred_probs, 3)
```

.question[
What can we conclude given these predicted probabilities?
]

---

### Interpreting coefficients 

Once again, we have a *linear* model on a transformation of the response. We can
interpret estimated coefficients in a familiar way:

```{r, echo = F}
tidy(logit_mod) 
```

Holding all other predictors constant, for each unit increase in base
speed, we expect the log-odds of being legendary to increase by 0.06. 
That is, a Pokemon that has a base speed one unit larger than another would have 
exp(0.06) $\approx$ 1.06 times the odds of being legendary.

.question[
How might we interpret dummy variables for categorical predictors?
]
